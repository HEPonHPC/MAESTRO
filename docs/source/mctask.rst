MC Task
=============================================

Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The base ``MCTask`` class at ``maestro/mc/mctask.py`` contains
useful utility functions that will allow you to interface with the MÃ†STRO
algorithm with ease. Here, we describe the functions that need to be implemented
in your class that inherits ``MCTask``, a useful utility function to deal with NaNs/:math:`\infty`
in the MC output data,
and the code documentation from ``MCTask`` class that describe the functions
already defined in this class.

Function inherited from but not defined in the ``MCTask`` base class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following functions need to be implemented in your class that inherits
``MCTask``. If these functions are not defined, when they are called, it will result in
an exception.

* ``run_mc(self)``: This function is used to execute the MC task as a function call. See
  :ref:`calling mc task as a function call tutorial<maestro_tutorial_mc_function_call>` for an example.
* ``merge_statistics_and_get_max_sigma(self)``: This function is used to merge
  statistics (for multi-fidelity runs) and get the maximum standard deviation
  across all parameters from the MC run.
* ``convert_mc_output_to_df(self, all_param_directory)``: Convert the output from the MC
  simulator for all parameters in the ``all_param_directory`` to a pandas_ data frame output.
  An example dataframe output is shown below.
  In this example, there are three parameters and two terms of the objective function.
  Terms that end with ``.P`` are the parameters and those ending with ``.V`` are the values
  associated with either the ``MC``, i.e., MC sample values  or the ``DMC``, i.e., MC standard deviation
  values. You can add more rows, i.e, more sets of parameter and values for additional terms in
  the objective function or more columns, i.e., more components of the each term of the objective that
  come from the MC simulator.::

        >df
                        MC                      DMC
        Term1.P        [[1,2],[3,4],[6,3]]     [[1,2],[3,4],[6,3]]
        Term1.V        [19, 18, 17]            [99, 98, 97]
        Term2.P        [[1,2],[3,4],[6,3]]     [[1,2],[3,4],[6,3]]
        Term2.V        [29, 28, 27]            [89, 88, 87]


Dealing with NaNs/:math:`\infty` in MC output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To deal with NaNs/:math:`\infty` in MC output, we provide a useful utility function::

    def check_and_resolve_nan_inf(self,data, all_param_directory,term_names,group_names=None)

The strategy used to deal with NaNs/:math:`\infty` in MC output is as follows:

* If ``group_names`` is not None i.e., groups are specified, then try to interpolate NaNs/:math:`\infty`
  for terms within each group for each parameter
* If ``group_names`` is None i.e., groups are not specified or if interpolation does not completely resolve
  the issue, then:

  * If the NaNs/:math:`\infty` was encountered in the start parameter,
    then raise an exception
  * If the NaNs/:math:`\infty` was encountered in the iterate (subproblem ``argmin``),
    then use the surrogate models from the current iteration to fill in the missing
    values
  * If the NaNs/:math:`\infty` was encountered in the adaptive sample, then
    drop the parameter from the corresponding term
